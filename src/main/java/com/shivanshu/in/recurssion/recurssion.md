# Recursion

## Why to learn Recursion
---
* Easy to write and read.
* A problem can be broken down into sub problem.
* Heavily used in data structure such as Tree and Graphs.
* Used in Divide and Conquer, Greedy and Dynamic programming.

## What is format of Recursion
* A base case at which function does not recur.
* A recursive case where function do recur.

## Recursion VS Iteration
* Space efficiency - As functions will be stored in stack during computation,
its space efficiency is less than Iteration.
* Time efficiency - As operation requires lot of Push and Pop operation its time efficiency
is less than Iteration.
* Ease of writing code is better then Iteration.

## Practical use of Recursion
* Stack
* Tree
* Sorting
* Divide and Conquer
* Dynamic Programming
