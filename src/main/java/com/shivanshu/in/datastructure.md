# Types of Data Structure

## Primitive Data Structure
Primitive data structure are used to hold single value.
### Types of Primitive data structure
* Integer
* Float
* Character
* Boolean

## Non Primitive Data Structure
Non Primitive data structure hold multiple values.
### Types of Non Primitive data structure
#### Linear Data Structure
It traverses the data elements sequentially ie only one data item can be directly reached from a given data point.
**Types**
* Array
* LinkedList
* Stack
* Queue

#### Non Linear Data Structure
In its structure each data item is connected to multiple other data items.
**Types**
* Graph
* Tree

** In Non primitive data structure Array and LinkedList are physical data structure and others logical data structure. **
